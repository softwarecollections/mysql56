Package %{?scl_name} provides MySQL database server delivered as a Software
Collection (SCL). For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{?scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working
MySQL database server.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 || 0%{?fedora} >= 15
Usage: systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}mysqld
%else
Usage: service %{?scl_prefix}mysqld start
%endif

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{?_scl_root}
in case of the %{?scl_name} collection.

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It is a
client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld)
and many different client programs and libraries. This package contains
the MySQL server and some accompanying files and directories.

When you want to work with the %{?scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment. The only exception is starting and stopping
%{?scl_prefix}mysqld daemon, where scl environment is enabled
implicitely within the SysV init script or systemd unit file.

Configuration for the %{?scl_name} software collection is located
under %{_sysconfdir}.

MySQL server listens on network soket (by default port 3306) and unix socket
(by default /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock).

Examples:
scl enable %{?scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{?scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{?scl_name} 'mysql -u root -p'
  Run mysql shell from the %{?scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{?scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{?scl_name} software collection enabled.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 || 0%{?fedora} >= 15
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}mysqld 
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}mysqld start
%endif
    Starts the MySQL server from %{?scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{?scl_name} 'man mysql'
  Show man pages for the mysql command, which is a part of the
  %{?scl_name} software collection.

For running the test suite, which is available in %{?scl_prefix}mysql-test
package, see the %{_datadir}/mysql-test/README. Please, be aware that you need
to run all the commands mentioned in the README file in a proper SCL
environment. Thus the recommended way to run the test suite is to run the bash
with %{?scl_name} collection enabled:

scl enable %{?scl_name} bash
  Run bash with the %{?scl_name} collection enabled.

Files:
%{?_scl_scripts}/service-environment
Define which software collections should be enabled for the daemon process.
